# dalle-clone

Hi!

This project was developted to test OpenAI API `createImage()`

# setup

To test you need a OPENAI_API_KEY that you can get [here](https://openai.com/product) and your MongoDB url. Now you just need to place them in the `.env` file.

# run

In the `server` folder just run `yarn start` or `npm start`

In the `client` folder run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
and open the localhost url in your browser
